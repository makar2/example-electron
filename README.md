#Sample Node.js backend + Electron app with IPC and a Jest + Spectron test

Forked this repo with ipcRenderer and added a Jest + Spectron test as a working example

`nodeintegration` is set to `false`, but must be `true` in case checking browser height, width and minimized is needed.

to start the app:
```
npm start
```

to run tests:
```
npm test
```
